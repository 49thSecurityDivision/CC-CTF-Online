One flag was listed as being in a `free and available resource` related to the badge. Admittedly, this is vague. For anyone that looked for info related to the badge they would have found the eBay link listed on [carolinacon.org](https://carolinacon.org/) to buy one (now removed because they are no longer for sale) and in the eBay description was a link to a [repo](https://github.com/49thSecurityDivision/CarolinaconOnlineBadge) with the code and a badge building guide.

To quickly search a repo I recommend using the command `git grep`. In this case I used `git grep flag`. This returns the result `Binary file Carolina Con Online Badge Building Guide.pdf matches`. To search that document I used `grep -a flag "Carolina Con Online Badge Building Guide.pdf"` The `-a` forces grep to treat the pdf as raw text. This will get you the flag! `flag{T4vKjU4wDeJhWRNCqHK7EyeopUPGgxV3bGDXcxnGiHIBQHAZm3dUVmKxbnY11WND}`
